<h1>Saga @ the Movies (Weekend Challenge #5)</h1>
An app for displaying movies from a database

In this application, we are meant to display movies from a database and when each individual 'poster' is clicked upon it should take us to a page displaying a brief description of the film as well as the genre, title and aforementioned poster image.

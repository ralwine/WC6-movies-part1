<h1>Saga @ the Movies (Weekend Challenge #5)</h1>
<h2>An app for displaying movies from a database</h2>

In this application, we are meant to display movies from a database and when each individual 'poster' is clicked upon it should take us to a page displaying a brief description of the film as well as the genre, title and aforementioned poster image. I started by making an outline of how I wanted the project to look and partly map out process as well.

My first step after installing and hooking in the necessary dependencies was to begin constructing the details page, and I began by the posters clickable to trigger a page change. I added a 'Back to List' button for my second page to allow a return to the main screen. I decided I would create a new GET route to handle the requests for additonal movie data from the database, but I was only able to obtain the id. I refactored into more components to spread things out, did further testing with POSTMAN, but I am still not able to get the other details to append to DOM. Will revisit this!

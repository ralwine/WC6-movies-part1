WC6 - PART 1: MOVIE SAGAS APP 
React-Redux with Redux-Sagas

-ROUGH OUTLINE-

Initializing:
    - Set up DB [x]
    - Install dependencies and hook in where needed [x]
    - Check files for other necessary hooks and call in where needed [x]

Base things:
    - First ('Home/List' or rather '/') page view is already complete, 
    but we need to set up the second ('/details') and link to it. 
    Refactor to make page with nothing but a page change button at this point. Hook in and utilize (useHistory) to move between screens [x]
    - Set up to show individual movie data on details page when spcific 
    movie poster is clicked. Will need from movies DB:
        title
            - GET 
                - server []
                - function/client []
            - reducer/saga/store []
            - render []
        description
            - GET 
                - server []
                - function/client []
            - reducer/saga/store []
            - render []
        poster
            - GET 
                - server []
                - function/client []
            - reducer/saga/store []
            - render []
    
    Let's test this premise first: 'Remember `req.params` and `:id`?'[]

    - Here comes the really tough part, will need more than one in certain cases.
    Will need from genres DB:
        name
            - GET 
                - server [x]
                - function/client []
            - reducer/saga/store []
            - render []
